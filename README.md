# techno-sam's nvim config

## Notes

This is here for the curious, no support will be given.

My neovim setup is pretty rust-optimized, so you should have rustup set up *with* rust-analyzer.

These instructions are for linux, but should be fairly easy to adapt to other OSes.

1. [install neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md). You'll be wanting the bleeding-edge nightly release.
